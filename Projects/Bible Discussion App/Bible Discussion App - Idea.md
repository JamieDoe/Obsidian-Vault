# Idea

The Bible is a complex, information rich book and is very hard to understand - especially for children or people who are new to faith. When reading the Bible, many questions will arise. These questions will be challenging, clarifying, encouraging or insightful. The apps idea aims to provide a way for you to have these questions answered. 

When reading a passage - you will be prompted with a series of questions based on the text - and previous texts that relate, with the intention of clarifying and teaching the Bible based off open discussion with loved ones.

## App Should:

- User should be able to create an account with a profile.
- Have a complete and chronological Bible including the Apocrypha.
	- The bible should feature a text to speech toggle for accessibly.
- Home page should feature popular chapters or studies that the user might want to read and question.
- When reading the text you might come across a more complex verse or two, these verses will feature a question outline providing context clarifying any questions that might arise.
- Once you get to the end of the passage - the user will be prompted with a series of questions based on the text and previous relating texts.
	- User will also be prompted with a prayer relating to the text.
- Home page should also feature a stats bar featuring how much of the bible you've read via a percentage.
